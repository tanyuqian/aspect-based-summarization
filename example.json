yes, i think it can. and it can be in a short space of time.\" these positive assertions are backed by the huge interest u.s. fans showed in last year's world cup in brazil. team usa's group stage clash with portugal attracted 25 million viewers, according to figures from tv ratings firm, nielsen. that's considerably more than the 15 million baseball's 2013 world series averaged on fox or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 nba finals on abc. anyone who saw 20,000 pumped-up young fans pack out chicago's grant park to cheer on their country via big screens, meanwhile, would find it hard to argue against soccer in the u.s. now being anything other than a big deal. reaching this promising stage, however, has been anything but a smooth ride. the mls was reported to have lost as much as $250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season. three teams -- miami fusion, tampa bay mutiny (both in 2001) and chivas usa (2014) -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles. a report by forbes at the end of 2013, meanwhile, claimed that only 10 out of 19 mls teams were profitable. and as recently as this week, mls players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end. then there's the way the league develops, attracts and trades players. a salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads. each side, however, has a number of spaces that can be allocated to \"off budget\" signings which are not included within the cap. this includes promising generation adidas players who enter the mls through the draft systems before completing their college education. homegrown players from club's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players (dps), usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors. one of the main criticisms of the mls and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like david beckham, freddie ljungberg and thierry henry to appear in the mls, it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory. why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time, after all? and herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see. although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity, it means mls teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not. head coach of sporting kansas, peter vermes, highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the kansas city star newspaper last year. \"we're in a place where at times you can't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances. we have a salary cap. they don't,\" vermes said. according to paulo teixeira, a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years, current philosophies with regards player-trading may be have to be tweaked to help the mls grow yet further. he describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with european passports. such talented individuals will have a sell-on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the mls to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the atlantic. theoretically, at least, this money can then be reinvested in the league, player development and attracting yet more promising players to the mls. this in turn will raise the standard further. an early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of oriol rossell, a spanish midfielder who moved from sporting kansas to sporting lisbon last year in a deal brokered by teixeira. rossell arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by fc barcelona in 2012. he excelled at kansas, winning the mls cup before being sold to the portuguese giants at a profit in june 2014. teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish. it could also be achieved by signing dps closer to the peak stage of their career, he added. this last point is something that appears be happening already. \"before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in europe,\" teixeira said. \"(but) villa is not an old guy, (frank) lampard is still going strong\" and both could still offer something to teams in europe, he said by way of example of new york city's first dp signings. nevertheless, he continued, the signing of more young players with big potential  \"is probably something we'll see more of.\" whether teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead. either way, that brave new mls dawn that broke over san jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning. cnn's don riddell contributed to this story.",

yes, i think it can. and it can be in a short space of time.\" these positive assertions are backed by the huge interest u.s. fans showed in last year's world cup in brazil. team usa's group stage clash with portugal attracted 25 million viewers, according to figures from tv ratings firm, nielsen. that's considerably more than the 15 million baseball's 2013 world series averaged on fox or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 nba finals on abc. anyone who saw 20,000 pumped-up young fans pack out chicago's grant park to cheer on their country via big screens, meanwhile, would find it hard to argue against soccer in the u.s. now being anything other than a big deal. reaching this promising stage, however, has been anything but a smooth ride. the mls was reported to have lost as much as $250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season. three teams -- miami fusion, tampa bay mutiny (both in 2001) and chivas usa (2014) -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles. a report by forbes at the end of 2013, meanwhile, claimed that only 10 out of 19 mls teams were profitable. and as recently as this week, mls players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end. then there's the way the league develops, attracts and trades players. a salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads. each side, however, has a number of spaces that can be allocated to \"off budget\" signings which are not included within the cap. this includes promising generation adidas players who enter the mls through the draft systems before completing their college education. homegrown players from club's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players (dps), usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors. one of the main criticisms of the mls and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like david beckham, freddie ljungberg and thierry henry to appear in the mls, it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory. why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time, after all? and herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see. although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity, it means mls teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not. head coach of sporting kansas, peter vermes, highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the kansas city star newspaper last year. \"we're in a place where at times you can't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances. we have a salary cap. they don't,\" vermes said. according to paulo teixeira, a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years, current philosophies with regards player-trading may be have to be tweaked to help the mls grow yet further. he describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with european passports. such talented individuals will have a sell-on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the mls to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the atlantic. theoretically, at least, this money can then be reinvested in the league, player development and attracting yet more promising players to the mls. this in turn will raise the standard further. an early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of oriol rossell, a spanish midfielder who moved from sporting kansas to sporting lisbon last year in a deal brokered by teixeira. rossell arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by fc barcelona in 2012. he excelled at kansas, winning the mls cup before being sold to the portuguese giants at a profit in june 2014. teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish. it could also be achieved by signing dps closer to the peak stage of their career, he added. this last point is something that appears be happening already. \"before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in europe,\" teixeira said. \"(but) villa is not an old guy, (frank) lampard is still going strong\" and both could still offer something to teams in europe, he said by way of example of new york city's first dp signings. nevertheless, he continued, the signing of more young players with big potential  \"is probably something we'll see more of.\" whether teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead. either way, that brave new mls dawn that broke over san jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning. cnn's don riddell contributed to this story.",

yes, i think it can. and it can be in a short space of time.\" these positive assertions are backed by the huge interest u.s. fans showed in last year's world cup in brazil. team usa's group stage clash with portugal attracted 25 million viewers, according to figures from tv ratings firm, nielsen. that's considerably more than the 15 million baseball's 2013 world series averaged on fox or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 nba finals on abc. anyone who saw 20,000 pumped-up young fans pack out chicago's grant park to cheer on their country via big screens, meanwhile, would find it hard to argue against soccer in the u.s. now being anything other than a big deal. reaching this promising stage, however, has been anything but a smooth ride. the mls was reported to have lost as much as $250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season. three teams -- miami fusion, tampa bay mutiny (both in 2001) and chivas usa (2014) -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles. a report by forbes at the end of 2013, meanwhile, claimed that only 10 out of 19 mls teams were profitable. and as recently as this week, mls players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end. then there's the way the league develops, attracts and trades players. a salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads. each side, however, has a number of spaces that can be allocated to \"off budget\" signings which are not included within the cap. this includes promising generation adidas players who enter the mls through the draft systems before completing their college education. homegrown players from club's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players (dps), usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors. one of the main criticisms of the mls and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like david beckham, freddie ljungberg and thierry henry to appear in the mls, it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory. why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time, after all? and herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see. although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity, it means mls teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not. head coach of sporting kansas, peter vermes, highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the kansas city star newspaper last year. \"we're in a place where at times you can't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances. we have a salary cap. they don't,\" vermes said. according to paulo teixeira, a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years, current philosophies with regards player-trading may be have to be tweaked to help the mls grow yet further. he describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with european passports. such talented individuals will have a sell-on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the mls to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the atlantic. theoretically, at least, this money can then be reinvested in the league, player development and attracting yet more promising players to the mls. this in turn will raise the standard further. an early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of oriol rossell, a spanish midfielder who moved from sporting kansas to sporting lisbon last year in a deal brokered by teixeira. rossell arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by fc barcelona in 2012. he excelled at kansas, winning the mls cup before being sold to the portuguese giants at a profit in june 2014. teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish. it could also be achieved by signing dps closer to the peak stage of their career, he added. this last point is something that appears be happening already. \"before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in europe,\" teixeira said. \"(but) villa is not an old guy, (frank) lampard is still going strong\" and both could still offer something to teams in europe, he said by way of example of new york city's first dp signings. nevertheless, he continued, the signing of more young players with big potential  \"is probably something we'll see more of.\" whether teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead. either way, that brave new mls dawn that broke over san jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning. cnn's don riddell contributed to this story.",

        "document": "my vote for father of the year goes to curt schilling. the former major league baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually-explicit comments about schilling's teenage daughter. the drama started, innocently enough, on february 25, when schilling played the role of a proud father. he sent a tweet congratulating his daughter, gabby, on being accepted to salve regina university, where she'll play softball. it read: \"congrats to gabby schilling who will pitch for the salve regina seahawks next year!! \u2014 curt schilling (@gehrig38)\" almost immediately, responses came in from young men, complete strangers who apparently followed schilling on twitter. the tweets quickly went from immature, to creepy, to repugnant. threats of rape were common. the tweets were deleted, and the accounts were closed after this story went viral. but not before schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog. what was said about 17-year-old gabby schilling wasn't just obnoxious. it was vile and obscene. what was said wasn't just mean and ugly. it was threatening and scary. as a parent, it's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public caning as a logical punishment for such transgressions. these misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity, the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites, where you feel free to be a  despicable human being because, you think, no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words. if so, they thought wrong. they couldn't hide. they were found out, and they got the throttling they so richly deserved. thanks to dad. according to schilling, who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are, two people have already paid a price due to their tweets. one was a student disc jockey at a community college in new jersey, who was suspended, and the other was a part-time ticket seller for the new york yankees, who was fired. concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide, schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved. bravo for him. i'm sure that, all across america, dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at schilling's self-control. i have two daughters of my own, and he's a better man than me. if ever there was a case where profanity-spewing malcontents deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap, this is it. so what additional insights can we draw, and what larger lessons can we learn, from this unexpected but predictable collision of old-fashioned parenthood and newfangled media? there are a few. the first is about accountability, the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid. but schilling wouldn't let them. at their best, social media sites like twitter, facebook, instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community. at their worst, they become digital sandboxes and locker rooms where people think have a license to misbehave without having to worry about consequences. we need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability. there's also something to be said about protective parents, and how essential they are to a working society. we should still be concerned about those overprotective parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews. we shouldn't bubblewrap our kids, and keep them from playing outdoors, and then sit around wondering why they're soft, timid, and risk-averse. but protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style. a parent's top job is to protect his children. schilling did his job. finally, it's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules, standards, and expectations that should guide your behavior. there are things you don't say. there are boundaries, ways that we expect you to behave so you don't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself, your friends, and your family. if you don't have social skills, you don't belong on social media. the tweets make you wince. but in this story, you'll still find plenty to smile about. this whole drama unfolded because schilling was proud of his daughter. now, given how he reacted, we all have reason to be proud of him. \u200b.",
